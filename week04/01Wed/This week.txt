Recall:
 - We wish to split our programs into a set of 
   functions (for many reasons, check slides)
 - we will organize 'related things' into 'components',
   which are made up of a .c and a .h file
    - declarations and the like in .h file and
      implementation in .c file (no exceptions!)

Now, 
00. from tuesday, a short note about how CLion tries to help us
0. from last week: a short note about bool
1. A quick dive into debugger (step through our current program)
2. complete the 'explosion' of our example
    a. 
		#pragma once 

		<content>
       or
		#ifndef UTILS
		#define UTILS

		<content>

		#endif

3. unit tests - automation (sep of duties or single resp)
	- multiple unit tests (all cases)
	- must use notion of expected vs. actual
4. pass by value, pass by reference

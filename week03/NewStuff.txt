style things:
    1) comment header block  include your name
    2) good/descriptive variable names
    3) good structure/ proximity  of variable and use
    4) no magic values.
    5) consistency  (pick some best practices and stick to them)

printf, scanf - be sure to match number of format specifiers to parameters

size_t is useful when negative numbers are undesirable and/or when trying to be
portable across architectures

lvalue, rvalue
    1) lvalue has an accessible storage location (a place to put it)
    2) rvalue does not
    * especially useful when trying to understand error messages
